## 📄 Paper 16: “RAGAS: An Evaluation Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation”
**Authors**: Jain et al., 2023  
**RAGAS** = **Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment**

### 🔍 Simple Explanation:
This paper introduces **RAGAS**, a framework to automatically evaluate how well RAG systems perform. Instead of just checking if the final answer is correct, RAGAS breaks down the performance of **each part of the pipeline**: retrieval, generation, and context relevance.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- **Faithfulness**: Does the answer rely only on retrieved documents?
- **Answer Correctness**: Does the answer actually match the ground truth?
- **Context Precision**: Are the retrieved documents relevant to the question?
- **Context Recall**: Did we retrieve everything we needed?

All these metrics can be computed without human annotation using **LLM-based evaluation**.

### ✍️ Example Use Case:
You build a chatbot that answers support questions. RAGAS can tell you:
- Are the answers grounded in retrieved docs?
- Are the right docs being retrieved?
- Are there missing documents that should’ve been used?

### 💡 Real-World Analogy:
Imagine grading a student not just on their answer, but also on how well they used their textbook, if they cited the right sources, and whether they skipped important parts.

### 🧩 Why It Matters:
- First **comprehensive, automatic eval framework** for RAG  
- Helps identify whether your RAG app is hallucinating, over-relying on the model, or failing at retrieval  
- Essential for **productionizing** LLM systems with reliability and traceability
