## 📄 Paper 22: “Chain of Thought Prompting Elicits Planning in Large Language Models”
**Authors**: Wei et al., 2022  
**Focus Here**: How CoT enables **planning behavior** in agents

### 🔍 Simple Explanation:
This paper laid the groundwork for using **Chain of Thought (CoT)** not just for math and logic, but for **planning tasks**—where the LLM needs to take a series of steps toward a goal (e.g., writing a report, coding a tool, or solving a puzzle).

The insight: Asking models to “think step-by-step” lets them **simulate multi-step plans**, which is a foundation for **agent-based systems**.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- **Sequential Reasoning**: CoT helps LLMs break down goals into sub-goals.
- **Plan + Act**: Enables the model to interleave reasoning and tool use—like making decisions while browsing or querying a database.
- **Useful in LangGraph**: The same thinking style is used to structure **stateful flows** in multi-step graphs.

### ✍️ Example Task:
“Find the best hotel in Paris under $300 for next weekend and summarize the reviews.”

Without CoT: Model guesses or fails.  
With CoT:  
1. Check dates  
2. Search for hotels  
3. Filter by price  
4. Read reviews  
5. Summarize  
→ Better result!

### 💡 Real-World Analogy:
Like giving your assistant a checklist: they’ll perform better when they plan each step first rather than just winging it.

### 🧩 Why It Matters:
- Extends CoT from **reasoning** to **planning**
- Used heavily in **LangChain/LangGraph agents**, task decomposition, and RAG orchestration
- Makes LLMs behave **more like general-purpose problem solvers**
