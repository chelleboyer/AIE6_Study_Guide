## 📄 Paper 21: “RAG-Fusion: Leveraging Multiple Queries for Better Retrieval-Augmented Generation”
**Authors**: Shi et al., 2024  
**AKA**: Ask multiple questions, get better answers.

### 🔍 Simple Explanation:
Instead of relying on **a single query** to retrieve documents for RAG, this paper shows that using **multiple, diverse rewrites of the same question** gives **more complete, accurate context**—resulting in better answers from the language model.

This approach is called **RAG-Fusion**.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- **Query Variants**: Generate several reworded versions of the original question.
- **Retrieve Separately**: Run each query through the retriever independently.
- **Rank & Merge**: Use scoring (like Reciprocal Rank Fusion) to combine and re-rank the most relevant results.

### 🧪 Why This Works:
Sometimes a single query misses important pieces. Variants help capture:
- Alternate phrasings  
- Clarifying angles  
- Synonyms and related concepts

More angles → better coverage → better grounding.

### 💡 Real-World Analogy:
Imagine researching a topic by asking different experts the same question in different ways. You’re more likely to get a rich, well-rounded answer than just asking once.

### 🧩 Why It Matters:
- Boosts RAG system performance without training new models  
- Works with **any retriever + generator combo**
- Powers **more robust enterprise search**, **support chatbots**, and **multilingual Q&A systems**
