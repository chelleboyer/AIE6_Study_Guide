## 📄 Paper 6: “LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models”
**Authors**: Touvron et al., 2023

### 🔍 Simple Explanation:
This paper introduced **LLaMA**, a family of powerful **open-source** language models that could match (or beat) closed models like GPT-3—but with **way fewer parameters**.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- **Smaller but smarter**: LLaMA-13B performs on par with GPT-3 (175B parameters)
- **Open weights**: Unlike GPT or Claude, anyone can download and run LLaMA locally
- **Training efficiency**: Trained on high-quality curated data → better performance per parameter

### 💡 Real-World Analogy:
It’s like building a fuel-efficient car that goes just as fast as a gas-guzzling sports car.

### 🧩 Why It Matters:
- Kickstarted the **open-source LLM movement**
- Made it possible for companies to run LLMs **privately and affordably**
